I have created a main page containing two recipes of relevenance. One as Lasagna and one as Spaghetti. I have noticed a small issue regarding the uploading of pictures onto the site and cannot seem to find a solution as this is not my main computer. However it is fine considering its mac and there doesnt seem to be any other overhanging issues connecting to the image not appearing. Personally i copied the details from my initially created lasagna and used similar code for spaghetti besides the actual information.
